        <h2>Dog Boarding</h2>
        <p>At Family Pet Resort, we are an all-inclusive all-suites resort that provides everything for your pet during
            their stay with us. We are happy to provide every guest with plush bedding and plenty of toys, so there's no
            need to bring any from home. We proudly serve Canidae brand Low Residue dog food; however, if you choose to
            provide your own food, please provide pre-measured baggies with feeding instructions. For those dogs with a
            sweet tooth, ice cream treats and biscuits are available, as well as gourmet stuffed kong treats.</p>

        <p>What do you have in mind when you think of a typical boarding kennel? You will not find a more elite kennel
            in Pennsylvania. Please come in and visit us and see for yourself what sets our family friendly resort apart
            from the other kennels. Our canine accommodations offer all the services you would expect from a five-star
            resort including room service, maid service, soothing music and clean &amp; comfortable climate-controlled
            suites. Our state of the art facilities also exchange fresh air throughout the resort approximately 6 to 8
            times per hour.</p>
        <p>Luxury Suites start from Only $32.00 per night.</p>
        <p>Contact us about our Ultra Luxury Vacation Villas that include TV's and our Oversized Family Suites for
            families with multiple pets.</p>
