        <p class="secondp">The museum is located at Grant Beach Park, inside four antique train cars, including a
            1943-era Frisco Locomotive No. 4524, installed at the park in 1953. The museum also includes a Burlington
            Baggage Car, a Chicago and Northwestern Bilevel Commuter Car and a Burlington Northern Caboose. All cars are
            connected and may be walked through. The museum has artifacts, equipment, photos, paintings, videos and much
            more from the St. Louis - San Francisco (Frisco) Railroad and other Railroads. There are many hands-on
            activities for kids and adults.</p>
